Hello, I am Wenkang Zhang, a senior student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I've carried out research on 3DGS and its extensions (dynamic/compact) in [SJTU Media Lab](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Zhengxue Cheng](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/zhengxue-cheng/) and [Li Song](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/li-song/). Previously I also participated in several school-level research projects, including robotic grasping detection (advised by [Xinwu Liang](https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/szdw/szml/51)) and submersible development (advised by [Jianping He](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/JPHE)).


This summer, I work as an intern in [Paxini Tech](https://paxini.com/), Shanghai. My current focus is real2sim2real for robotics using GS. I am implementing a photo-realistic and controlable pipeline for robotic data generation and policy training with reduced sim-to-real gap.

Hello, I am Wenkang Zhang(å¼ æ–‡åº·), a 3rd-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Engineering (EE) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I'm currently carrying research as an intern in [SJTU Media Lab](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Zhengxue Cheng](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/zhengxue-cheng/) and Prof. [Li Song](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/li-song/). I'm working on 3D scene reconstrcution (mainly using 3DGS) and its extensions (dynamic scene, compact representation, et al.)

Previously, I participated in a school-level research project (PRP) that focuses on robotic grasping detection using RGBD images in the perceptual domain, advised by Prof. [Xinwu Liang](https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/szdw/szml/51).

I am looking for a PhD/Master position in this application season! ðŸ‘ŠðŸŽ“ðŸ”¥

Hello, I am Wenkang Zhang, a junior student majoring in Information Engineering (EE) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I'm primarily working on 3DGS and its extensions, including dynamic reconstrcution and compact representation. I've carried out research as an intern in [SJTU Media Lab](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Zhengxue Cheng](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/zhengxue-cheng/) and Prof. [Li Song](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/li-song/).  

This summer, I work as an intern in [Paxini Tech](https://paxini.com/), Shanghai. My current focus is real2sim2real for robotics using GS. I am implementing a photo-realistic and controlable pipeline for robotic data generation and policy training with reduced sim-to-real gap.

Previously in my freshman year, I participated in a university-level research project (PRP) that focuses on robotic grasping detection using RGBD images in the perceptual domain, advised by Prof. [Xinwu Liang](https://www.aero.sjtu.edu.cn/szdw/szml/51) from [IRMV Lab](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I am looking for a PhD/Master position in this season! ðŸ‘ŠðŸŽ“ðŸ”¥
